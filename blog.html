	  <h4>July 8, 2019: Machine Learning Day 1</h4>
		  <p>In which Brett tutors his laptop</p>
			</header>
			<p>
			I'm starting this week with a new adventure a <em>deep</em> dive into machine learning, 
			by teaching myself: (a) what machine learning really is, (b) coding up a 1D convolutional
			neural net, and (c) trying to apply the CNN to real Kepler data. 
			</p>
			<p>
			Unsurprisingly, the goal
			for this project is to hunt for HAT-P-11-like objects in Kepler and TESS photometry, by
			hunting for starspot occultations within known transiting systems. I've developed a forward
			model for starspot occultations called <em><a href="https://fleck.readthedocs.io">fleck</a></em>
			which I'm using to generate thousands of simulated transit light curves with Kepler-like noise, 
			labeling each one as "occults spots" or "occults no spots". The resulting catalog of labelled light
			curves are then used as a training set for my supervised learning technique of choice for this
			problem, called convolutional neural networks.
			</p>
			<p>
			When I make it further along in this project, I'll write a post explaining CNNs in more detail, 
			but for now, suffice it to say: it is a machine learning technique that can be used to classify
			time-series signals quickly. I'm going to use the rest of this short post to reflect on lessons learned
			in day one of machine learning bootcamp: 
			<ol>
				<li>95% of my effort is likely to be spent constructing a realistic enough training set for the model
				to produce useful predictions.</li>
				<li>I couldn't have made any progress today, or maybe ever, without 
				<a href="https://keras.io">keras</a>. </li>
				<li>Having a training set doesn't make it a realistic or useful one.</li>
				<li><em>The machine learns only what you teach it</em>.</li>
			</ol>

			Lots of people preach ML as the hammer to solve your big data problems, but I'm learning that
			it takes a <em>lot</em> of work to make your data ML-ready.

	<h4>July 4, 2019: The unbearable whiteness of noise</h4>
	<p>Hunting for starspot occultations</p>
</header>
<p>It's no secret that I'm enamored with systems like HAT-P-11 and Kepler-17, 
two bright exoplanet host stars which happen to be covered in starspots. During a 
transit event when the planet passes in front of the dark starspots, less light goes missing 
than at times when the planet occults bright regions of the star, creating a 
positive "bump" in the light curves superimposed on the transit signal. These bumps 
encode the positions and sizes of starspots.  
 </p>
<p>TESS is going to find a bunch of planets orbiting bright stars, and it's my hope that
	at least one of those planets orbits a star with abundant starspots. I've been periodically
	downloading the most recent TOI lists, and combing through the light curves for any 
	transiting exoplanet candidates that have extra noise in their residuals. Most of the transits
	look like this: 
</p>
	<iframe src="https://widgets.figshare.com/articles/8668406/embed?show_title=1" width="568" height="351" allowfullscreen="true" frameborder="0"></iframe>
<p>
Today I looked through >200 light curves of transiting exoplanet candidates from the TESS 
<a href="https://exofop.ipac.caltech.edu/tess/view_toi.php">TOI list</a> brighter than 12 mag,
orbiting cool stars, with transit depths >0.5 mmag. I found some quite active exoplanet host stars
judging by the apparent rotational modulation of the star out-of-transit, but didn't find any 
stars that had residual signals in-transit that could best be explained by spot occultations. 
</p>
<p>
I'm not going to give up on this hunt -- after all, there were only two great spotted stars in the
original <em>Kepler</em> field out of thousands of planet hosts. But I am starting to wonder about
the <em>occurrence rate</em> of spot occultations. I'm going to spend the rest of the day thinking about
statistics and generating simulated transits of ensembles of spotted stars in order to determine how
many other HAT-P-11-like systems one might expect to discover with TESS. If you've already thought
about this, give me a shout!

	<h4>July 3, 2019: Whose line is it anyway?</h4>
	<p>Help needed!</p>
</header>
<p>This week I'm working on identifying magnetic activity-sensitive spectral features in 
HARPS spectra, inspired by the TiO molecular band modeling approach in the 
<a href="#UTC20190702">previous blog post</a>. If you think about spectra of high 
temperature molecules, this post is for you!</p>
<p>
<strong>The idea</strong> is that we have a wealth of high
resolution, high S/N observations of the Sun recorded by HARPS, which should contain 
information about the magnetic activity of the Sun. While those HARPS spectra were taken, 
NASA's Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) was collecting continuum imaging of the Sun, which 
can serve as a sort of "answer key" for how much of the solar surface was covered in 
sunspots during each HARPS observation.  
</p>
<p>I've come up with a technique for identifying activity sensitive lines by searching for 
spectral channels whose flux correlates with the total spot coverage of the Sun, which predicts
that the spectral features are activity sensitive at the red dashed lines in the following plot:
</p> 
<iframe src="https://widgets.figshare.com/articles/8668406/embed?show_title=0" width="650" height="402" allowfullscreen="true" frameborder="0"></iframe>
<p><strong>Does anyone know how to identify these anonymous lines?</strong> In the above figure I've 
plotted the VALD3 line list for the Sun, which identifies most of the atomic features. I've looked
at HITEMP databases for water and CO and haven't found correlations with this little suspicious 
line list.
</p>
<p>The lines occur at: 
	<ul>
		<li>5132.53 Å</li>
		<li>5132.55 Å</li>
		<li>5138.0 Å</li>
		<li>5141.38 Å</li>
		<li>5157.01 Å</li>
		<li>5174.19 Å</li>
		<li>5178.0 Å</li>
	</ul>

	<h4>July 2, 2019: TiO Molecular Band Modeling</h4>
	<p>The enduring, elusive spectroscopic hunt for TiO molecular bands [<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.00423">paper</a>]</p>
</header>
<h6>Intro</h6>
<p><a href="https://gully.github.io">Michael Gully-Santiago</a> is fond of saying
	<blockquote>Starspots emit light!</blockquote>
	a backhanded acknowledgement that starspots are generally thought of as dark spots, 
	but their true nature is more complicated. I've spent the better part of two years 
	chasing a consequence of this fact, and the paper was just accepted, so I can finally
	talk about it! </p>
<p>Starspots change the apparent brightness of stars as a function of time, as thousands of
<em>Kepler</em> light curves will show you. But a lesser studied phenomenon is the way that 
starspots affect the <em>spectra</em> of stars.</p>
<p>There's a great series of papers by
O'Neal, Neff and Saar from the late 90's and early 00's on using this chromatic decifit of flux 
to our advantage. The authors studied several absorption bands of <strong>TiO</strong>, a 
molecule which forms at temperatures below about 4000 K, as a tracer of starspot coverage.
The idea goes: a G or K star with effective temperatures >4000 K should not have any TiO absorption
in their spectra, because they are too hot. However, starspots often have \(\Delta T \sim 500\) K 
and therefore can be cool enough to form TiO! The goal in this series of papers was to measure slight
flux deficits in the spectra of active G and K stars which are likely to have substantial starspot 
coverage by focusing on spectral bands of strong TiO absorption.</p>

<h6>Lessons Learned</h6>
<p>It has been about 20 years since those initial papers were written, so I got the itch to increment
the effort with the ARCES echelle spectrograph on the ARC 3.5 m Telescope at Apache Point Observatory. 
I collected about 80 hours of spectra of G and K stars, and collaborated with Jason Curtis and 
Charli Sakari on measuring spectroscopic \(T_\text{eff}\) and \(\log g\)s with <code>SME</code> 
and <code>MOOG</code>. We found that the spectroscopic temperatures agree really well with the Gaia DR2
Apsis pipeline's two-color (plus parallax) photometric temperatures. 
</p>
<p>The effort to measure TiO absorption turned out to be really tricky at our resolution \(R\sim31,500\) 
and S/N. We found significant starspot coverages consistent with previous studies for around a 
dozen stars, but we only had convincing "by-eye" detections of TiO absorption in systems with spot coverage
\(f_S \sim 0.5\). This turns out to be a consequence of flux weighting. At 7054 Å, where there's a 
strong TiO absorption band, suppose the blackbody flux of a spot is equivalent to a \(T_\text{eff} = 4000\) K 
source. That spot emits only 56% of the flux of a \(T_\text{eff} = 4500\) K source, a typical temperature for 
the photosphere of a K star. Thus if you have a K star that is 10% covered in spots, the total contribution 
of the spot's spectrum to the total spectrum is only 0.1 * 0.56 = 5%, where the other 95% of the flux is 
coming from the warmer photospheric component. Hunting for the measly missing 5% contribution to the 
flux centered on TiO bands is therefore tricky business. The flux-weighting effect kills your chances of 
measuring solar-like spot coverages in modest S/N spectra, but gives you a chance to measure very large 
starspot coverages like those of RS CVn stars.</p>

<h6>Future work</h6>
<p>I'm looking forward to trying this technique out with higher S/N, higher resolution spectra, like
	those from HIRES and HARPS. It'd be especially valuable if we could find a variation on the 
	technique that worked well in the near-infrared, so that we could use the TiO (or other molecular)
	band modeling to determine starspot coverage <em>during</em> exoplanet transit spectroscopy observations.
	I'm working with Steve Saar on writing up a state-of-the-field/post-mortem piece on the molecular
	band modeling technique, laying out the success and challenges and prospects for the future.

<p>Today was my first official day of work as NCCR PlanetS postdoc at the University of Bern, 
	working with Professors Kevin Heng and Brice-Olivier Demory. I look forward to joining the 
	vibrant community that is thriving here in Bern, and making the most of the amazing 
	collaborators that are stuck with me for the next few years.
    </p>
<p>I submitted a paper to the arXiv last night that I'm excited to share with you tomorrow.
