	<h4>July 2, 2019: TiO Molecular Band Modeling</h4>
	<p>The enduring, elusive spectroscopic hunt for TiO molecular bands</p>
</header>
<h6>Intro</h6>
<p><a href="https://gully.github.io">Michael Gully-Santiago</a> is fond of saying
	<blockquote>Starspots emit light!</blockquote>
	a backhanded acknowledgement that starspots are generally thought of as dark spots, 
	but their true nature is more complicated. I've spent the better part of two years 
	chasing a consequence of this fact, and the paper was just accepted, so I can finally
	talk about it! </p>
<p>Starspots change the apparent brightness of stars as a function of time, as thousands of
<em>Kepler</em> light curves will show you. But a lesser studied phenomenon is the way that 
starspots affect the <em>spectra</em> of stars.</p>
<p>There's a great series of papers by
O'Neal, Neff and Saar from the late 90's and early 00's on using this chromatic decifit of flux 
to our advantage. The authors studied several absorption bands of <strong>TiO</strong>, a 
molecule which forms at temperatures below about 4000 K, as a tracer of starspot coverage.
The idea goes: a G or K star with effective temperatures >4000 K should not have any TiO absorption
in their spectra, because they are too hot. However, starspots often have \(\Delta T \sim 500\) K 
and therefore can be cool enough to form TiO! The goal in this series of papers was to measure slight
flux deficits in the spectra of active G and K stars which are likely to have substantial starspot 
coverage by focusing on spectral bands of strong TiO absorption.</p>

<h6>Lessons Learned</h6>
<p>It has been about 20 years since those initial papers were written, so I got the itch to increment
the effort with the ARCES echelle spectrograph on the ARC 3.5 m Telescope at Apache Point Observatory. 
I collected about 80 hours of spectra of G and K stars, and collaborated with Jason Curtis and 
Charli Sakari on measuring spectroscopic \(T_\text{eff}\) and \(\log g\)s with <code>SME</code> 
and <code>MOOG</code>. We found that the spectroscopic temperatures agree really well with the Gaia DR2
Apsis pipeline's two-color (plus parallax) photometric temperatures. 
</p>
<p>The effort to measure TiO absorption turned out to be really tricky at our resolution \(R\sim31,500\) 
and S/N. We found significant starspot coverages consistent with previous studies for around a 
dozen stars, but we only had convincing "by-eye" detections of TiO absorption in systems with spot coverage
\(f_S \sim 0.5\). This turns out to be a consequence of flux weighting. At 7054 Å, where there's a 
strong TiO absorption band, suppose the blackbody flux of a spot is equivalent to a \(T_\text{eff} = 4000\) K 
source. That spot emits only 56% of the flux of a \(T_\text{eff} = 4500\) K source, a typical temperature for 
the photosphere of a K star. Thus if you have a K star that is 10% covered in spots, the total contribution 
of the spot's spectrum to the total spectrum is only 0.1 * 0.56 = 5%, where the other 95% of the flux is 
coming from the warmer photospheric component. Hunting for the measly missing 5% contribution to the 
flux centered on TiO bands is therefore tricky business. The flux-weighting effect kills your chances of 
measuring solar-like spot coverages in modest S/N spectra, but gives you a chance to measure very large 
starspot coverages like those of RS CVn stars.</p>

<h6>Future work</h6>
<p>I'm looking forward to trying this technique out with higher S/N, higher resolution spectra, like
	those from HIRES and HARPS. It'd be especially valuable if we could find a variation on the 
	technique that worked well in the near-infrared, so that we could use the TiO (or other molecular)
	band modeling to determine starspot coverage <em>during</em> exoplanet transit spectroscopy observations.
	I'm working with Steve Saar on writing up a state-of-the-field/post-mortem piece on the molecular
	band modeling technique, laying out the success and challenges and prospects for the future.

	<h4>July 1, 2019: New Job</h4>
	<p>First day of postdoc life</p>
</header>
<p>Today was my first official day of work as NCCR PlanetS postdoc at the University of Bern, 
	working with Professors Kevin Heng and Brice-Olivier Demory. I look forward to joining the 
	vibrant community that is thriving here in Bern, and making the most of the amazing 
	collaborators that are stuck with me for the next few years.
    </p>
<p>I submitted a paper to the arXiv last night that I'm excited to share with you tomorrow. 
If you like starspots, stellar effective temperatures, and Bayesian spectroscopic analysis, 
you'll like tomorrow's post!
